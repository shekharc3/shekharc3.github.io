My name is Chandra Shekhar, and I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Oklahoma (OU). Before coming to OU in August 2024, I completed my PhD in Public Policy and Environmental Philosophy at MIT in 2022, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Social Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). My work has been supported by the MIT Martin Family Society of Fellows, the MIT Science Impact Initiative, and the MIT Presidential Fellowship. <br>

My research examines the political economy of development, social policy, environmental philosophy, and social theory. I investigate how environmental degradation impacts socially vulnerable populations in North America, Africa, and Asia, reinforcing social contracts that benefit dominant groups while systematically marginalizing minority groups. I also explore the persistence of inefficient institutions, such as corruption in government organizations. Additionally, I focus on the philosophy of power and the philosophy of knowledge, using a methodological approach grounded in epistemological and ontological pluralism. <br>

When Iâ€™m not doing research, I love staying active and spending time outdoors. I also enjoy reading novels, playing the trombone, and jet-skiing.
