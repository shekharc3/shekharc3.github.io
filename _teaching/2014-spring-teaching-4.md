This course attracts graduate students and advanced undergraduates from MIT and Harvard departments with interests in environmental justice, environmental ethics, analytical tools for environmental assessment, and strategies for collaborative decision-making. I served as the Teaching Assistant to Professor [Larry Susskind](https://lawrencesusskind.mit.edu/) for this course.
