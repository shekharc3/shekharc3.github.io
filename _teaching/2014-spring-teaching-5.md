I served as a Teaching Assistant to Professors [Noelle Selin](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/noelle-selin/) and [Kenneth Oye](https://polisci.mit.edu/people/kenneth-oye) in this [course](https://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=IDS.412&style=verbatim&when=C&termleng=4&days_offered=*&start_time=*&duration=*&total_units=*). The course examined issues at the intersection of science, technology, and public policy. It was structured around political economy theories, adapted to address the integration of uncertain technical information into both public and private decision-making processes.
