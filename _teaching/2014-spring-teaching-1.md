This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key issues in the research process within social policy. It explores the philosophical foundations of research methods, the application of both qualitative and quantitative methods in international social and public policy, and the critical role of evidence in shaping policy decisions. The course was convened by [Dr. Johann Koehler](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/people/academic-staff/Dr-Johann-Koehler), and I delivered two lectures: one on using qualitative research and addressing missing data issues in international social and public policy research, and another on theorizing policy processes.
