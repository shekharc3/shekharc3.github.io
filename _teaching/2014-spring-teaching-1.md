This course was convened by [Dr. Johann Koehler](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/people/academic-staff/Dr-Johann-Koehler), and I delivered two lectures: one on using qualitative research and addressing missing data issues in international social and public policy research, and another on theorizing policy processes.
